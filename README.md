Doing this so, we want, at the end of the semester, to be able to:

•	Program problems in Swift to do well in an interview.
o	Built 13 apps completed and 3 on going.
o	With those apps we were able to learn and understand more about arrays, loops, SwiftUI, URL session, etc.

•	Use API’s and JSON files.
o	Built a weather app to understand API concepts
o	We have used open source libraries that will generate different files to facilitate the creation of our apps. It will convert the JSON into a class type.
o	Libraries and tools such as:
o	Quicktype that will Convert JSON into gorgeous, typesafe code in any language.

o	CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 71 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. It’s like npm for NodeJS or Maven for Java.
o	The Podfile is a specification that describes the dependencies of the targets of one or more Xcode projects.

o	How to implement it:

	target 'MyApp' do
use_frameworks!
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.0'
end

•	Have an understand of the language in a way that we can apply what we learned in this language to other languages.
o	Taken course using data structures in various languages.
o	Worked with API requests.
o	Networking.
o	Collection View.

•	Have the domain of the language in order to continue to create apps after this class.
o	A looking for ideas for our senior project.
